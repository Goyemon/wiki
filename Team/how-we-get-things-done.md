# How We Get Things Done

- We ship something every two weeks to keep the momentum.
- No tasks longer than one week – worst case, two weeks. If you just joined, get something done.
- One person per task. Get help from others, but you and you alone are accountable.
- You pick what to work on from our roadmap.
- Choose hard but not impossible goals.
- Peer-management.
  - Promise what you’ll do in the coming week in [the Discord channel](https://discord.gg/QrEagSk). Get it done – or publicly break your promise – next week.
  - Promise what you’ll do today in [the Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Cvs9ucz). Get it done – or publicly break your promise – next day.
