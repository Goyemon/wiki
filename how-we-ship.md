# How We Ship
- We ship something every week to keep the momentum.
- No tasks longer than one week – worst case, two weeks. If you just joined, ship something.
- One person per task. Get help from others, but you and you alone are accountable.
- You pick what to work on.
- Peer-management. Promise what you’ll do in the coming week. Deliver – or publicly break your promise – next week.
- Choose challenging tasks that stretch yourself and grow.
